        <h2>What is html?</h2>
        <p>HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language first announced in 1991. HTML is now in HTML5.2 as the latest update came in in 2021</p> 
        <p>HTML has few features that you can use to format your own website.</p>
        <p>Using h1 -> h6 gives you different sized titles. Do not mistake the title as what you can see on top of the web browser as the name of the website.</p>
        <table class="headers-format">
            <tr>

                <td><h1>H1</h1></td>
                <td><h2>H2</h2></td>
                <td><h3>H3</h3></td>
                <td><h4>H4</h4></td>
                <td><h5>H5</h5></td>
                <td><h6>H6</h6></td>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>As you see the font size goes down the further more you go with h'x' numbers.</p>
        <h3>What do you need in your html form?</h3>
        <p>You need the base of a html form. It will contain html, head, title and body. This is the bare minimum required. It will run with just html start and end tags, but it is not recommended. I will link below my go to html base that I use everytime I start doing a new html page.</p>
